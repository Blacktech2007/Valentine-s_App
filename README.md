Valentines Garage System developed by Rodriques Tiatus and Elly Kaendjere

INTRODUCTION
What is Valentine’s garage mobile app?
This is a mobile application that allows you to create, open and assign tasks to be done in the garage. Valentine or senior staff can add a job, that is, car details that have to be worked on. This app also enables you to view the task. Upon finishing a task from a checklist, an employee who worked on a task can mark it as done and add additional comments if available. This allows Valentine to track tasks done by individuals and also ensures that all tasks were done before a vehicle leaves their garage.
Which devices does the mobile app support?

How to install it.

Opening an APK file on your Android device just requires that you download it like you would any file, and then open it when asked. However, APK files installed outside of the Google Play store might not install right away because of a security block put into place.
To bypass this download restriction and install APK files from unknown sources, navigate to one of these menus, depending on your Android version:
Settings > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Special app access > Install unknown apps
Settings > Apps and notifications
Settings > Security
Depending on your device, you might need to give a specific app, such as Chrome, permission to install unofficial APK files. Or, if you see it, enable Install Unknown Apps or Unknown sources.
